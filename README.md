# HRone-dashboard

For this dashboard i have used scss and created variable for colors and make mixins for the responsiveness breakpoint, width, font-size so that i can use that in scss.

- for mobile responsiveness we can make tab section for celebration, feed and quick action or we can add celebration and quick action in the menu .
